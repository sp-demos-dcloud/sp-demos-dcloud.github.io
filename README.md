# WAN Automation Engine

In the past you have seen two main variants of the same demo, where the only difference has been the size of the demo topology and perhaps how fast it starts.

Now, we are building a new set of demos, utilizing WAE's flexible southbound capabilities and new features.

Below, is an overview to help you distinguish between them and help you find the one you want.

[*Cisco WAN Automation Engine 6.4.1 16-nodes v1*](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo/wae-641-w-16n-v1)

New in this demo is that we have Segment Routing and NSO included in the base demo.

16 IOS XRv router topology

Demo Scenarios:

-   Scenario 1. Offline Planning with MATE Design

-   Scenario 2. Bandwidth on Demand

-   Scenario 3. Tunnel Balancer

-   Scenario 4. Tunnel Builder

-   Scenario 5. Bandwidth Calendaring

-   Scenario 6. WAE API and Tunnel Split/Merge

-   Scenario 7. Segment Routing Tunnel Builder

-   Scenario 8. Tunnel Builder with NSO as Deployer

-   Scenario 9. WAE API with NSO as Deployer

## [Cisco WAN Automation Engine 6.4 8 nodes  Sandbox v1](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo/wae-64-sndbx-v1)

This is the **Cisco Live US WAE 6.4 LAB** made available as a **Sandbox**.

WAE is not configured, and the lab docs will walk you r though how to setup WAE.

Lab Topics:

-   WAE Design

-   Network Model

-   Manual Collection

-   Collection Server

-   PCEP/BGP-LS

-   Automation

-   Design Deployment

-   Using APIs

-   API Workflows

## [Cisco WAN Automation Engine 6.4 8-nodes v1](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo_news/cisco-wan-automation-engine-6-4-with-8-nodes-v1)

Same scenarios at WAE 6.3.1.

New in this demo is that we have Segment Routing and NSO included in the base demo.

This one has the following scenarios:

-   Scenario 1. Offline Planning with MATE Design

-   Scenario 2. Bandwidth on Demand

-   Scenario 3. Tunnel Balancer

-   Scenario 4. Tunnel Builder

-   Scenario 5. Bandwidth Calendaring

-   Scenario 6. WAE API and Tunnel Split/Merge

-   Scenario 7. Segment Routing Tunnel Builder

-   Scenario 8. Tunnel Builder with NSO as Deployer

-   Scenario 9. WAE API with NSO as Deployer

## [Cisco WAE 6.4 Topology Services with NSO 4.1.1 and 8 nodes v1](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo/wae64-ts-nso411-8n-v2)

The Cisco WAN Automation Engine (WAE) Topology Service is a lightweight service that provides NSO the capability to automate node discovery in a network. The service leverages the WAN Automation Engine key capabilities without requiring a WAE license.

These are the Scenarios:

-   Scenario 1: Using Guacamole

-   Scenario 2: Configure Discovery

-   Scenario 3: Run Data Collection

-   Scenario 4: Scheduled Collection
