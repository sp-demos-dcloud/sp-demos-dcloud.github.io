Service Provider dCloud Demos Information


**Overview of Overview**

The goal with this document is to explain differences between demos that may seem very similar and to help you navigate to the one best matching your needs.

 

The following Categories will be discussed:

 

1.  OpenDaylight (including OSC)

2.  WAE

3.  vMS/NFv

 

 

**OpenDaylight**

As Open Daylight is under constant development, we strive to post updates reflecting that.

 

**OpenDaylight Beryllium SR3 w Apps 8 nodes v1**

[***in QA***](https://cisco.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-1548845)

The Beryllium SR3 release

- No apps installed, but the following are installed from GitHub by the user:

- Pathman for MPLS TE

- BGP App

- Open Flow Manager

- Pathman Segment Routing

- netACL - add ACLs via NETCONF

 

[***Cisco APPs on ODL v1***](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo/apps-on-odl-v1)

Based on Beryllium SR2 and focuses on the APPs instead of general ODL features.

Has the following APPs configured and ready to run:

- Pathman for MPLS TE

- BGP App

- Open Flow Manager

- Pathman Segment Routing

- netACL - add ACLs via NETCONF

 

 

 

[***FRINX ODL Distribution Sandbox v1***](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo/frinx-odl-dist-sndbx-v1)

Based on Beryllium SR2

- Uses *Frinx* s/w Rel 1.2.3.

- Frinx Feature Manager

- Frinx System Manager

- Else similar to our Beryllium SR2 demo

 

 

**Wan Automation Engine**

In the past you have seen two main variants of the same demo, where the only difference has been the size of the demo topology and perhaps how fast it starts.

Now, we are building a new set of demos, utilizing WAE's flexible southbound capabilities and new features.

 

Below, is an overview to help you distinguish between them and help you find the one you want.

 

[***Cisco WAN Automation Engine 6.4 8 nodes  Sandbox v1***](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo/wae-64-sndbx-v1)

This is the Cisco Live US WAE 6.4 LAB made available as a Sandbox.

WAE is not configured, and the lab docs will walk you r though how to setup WAE.

Lab Topics:

-   WAE Design

-   Network Model

-   Manual Collection

-   Collection Server

-   PCEP/BGP-LS

-   Automation

-   Design Deployment

-   Using APIs

-   API Workflows

 

[***Cisco WAN Automation Engine 6.4 8-nodes v1***](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo_news/cisco-wan-automation-engine-6-4-with-8-nodes-v1)

 

Same scenarios as WAE 6.3.1.

New in this demo is that we have Segment Routing and NSO included in the base demo.

This one has the following scenarios:

-   Scenario 1. Offline Planning with MATE Design

-   Scenario 2. Bandwidth on Demand

-   Scenario 3. Tunnel Balancer

-   Scenario 4. Tunnel Builder

-   Scenario 5. Bandwidth Calendaring

-   Scenario 6. WAE API and Tunnel Split/Merge

-   Scenario 7. Segment Routing Tunnel Builder

-   Scenario 8. Tunnel Builder with NSO as Deployer

-   Scenario 9. WAE API with NSO as Deployer

 

 

[***Cisco WAN Automation Engine 6.4.1 16-nodes v1***](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo/cisco-wan-automation-engine-6-3-with-16-nodes-v1)

New in this demo is that we have Segment Routing and NSO included in the base demo.

The 16-node variant of this demo has a larger network topology, else identical to the 8-node setup.

This one has the following scenarios:

-   Scenario 1. Offline Planning with MATE Design

-   Scenario 2. Bandwidth on Demand

-   Scenario 3. Tunnel Balancer

-   Scenario 4. Tunnel Builder

-   Scenario 5. Bandwidth Calendaring

-   Scenario 6. WAE API and Tunnel Split/Merge

-   Scenario 7. Segment Routing Tunnel Builder

-   Scenario 8. Tunnel Builder with NSO as Deployer

-   Scenario 9. WAE API with NSO as Deployer

 

 

**Virtual Managed Services - CloudVPN**

[***Cisco Virtual Managed Services vMS 1.0 – Technology Preview v1.1 | Cisco dCloud***](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo/cisco-virtual-managed-services-vms-1-5-technology-preview-v1-0)

The vMS startup is fully automated and the user’s session will start with a working system.

The user can then:

-   Logon to the vMS Portal

-   Add a customer

-   Add sites

-   Select services

-   Select equipment

-   Deploy

 

[***Cisco CloudVPN Technology Simulator v2.1 | Cisco dCloud***](https://dcloud-cms.cisco.com/demo/cisco-cloudvpn-technology-preview-v2)

The perspective of this demonstration is from the end user and focuses on the end user interface (UI). Acting as the end user of a small organization, you will self-provision cloud VPN services to connect multiple sites securely.

Scenario 1: Provisioning VPN Services
